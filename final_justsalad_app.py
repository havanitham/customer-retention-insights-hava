# --- Problem Statement ---
st.header("üöÄ Project Background & Use Case")
st.markdown("""
In a competitive food service market, retaining customers is just as important as acquiring new ones. This dashboard simulates a use case relevant to **Just Salad's** loyalty and marketing initiatives:
- How do promotions impact customer spending?
- Can we segment customers based on recency?
- How do spending patterns differ across these segments?

# --- Strategic Takeaways ---
st.header("üí° Strategic Takeaways")

st.markdown("""
- üîÅ **Retention is a key challenge**: A majority of customers are inactive.
- üéÅ **Promos drive ROI**: Promo-accepting customers show a higher lifetime value.
- üìä **Segmented campaigns**: Tailoring messages based on recency (Active, Warm, At Risk) can significantly improve engagement.
- üí≥ **Encourage signups**: Customer data like phone/email is vital for delivering personalized value and tracking behavior.

# --- Field Study ---
st.header("üîç Field Observation: Subway Case Study")
st.markdown("""
While researching customer retention, I observed real-world breakdowns in loyalty strategy at a nearby **Subway** franchise:

- Despite ongoing weekly deals, customers were **not asked to submit emails or phone numbers** at checkout.
- Many customers, unaware of loyalty benefits, missed out on free meal opportunities.
- These missed interactions represent **lost engagement and data capture**.

**Takeaway**: Franchise-level operations must be held accountable for executing retention strategies. Monitoring, training, and periodic audits can ensure alignment with the brand's customer loyalty goals.
